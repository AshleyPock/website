<p>Yellow. My name is Ashley Pock. I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at UCI.</p> 

<p>I'm currently a learning assistant for an intro to programming class, where I assist underclassmen with lab assignments alongside a TA. I hope to use this website to archive notes on stuff I've learned and share my own thoughts and experiences.</p> 

<p>Lately, I've been interested in learning more about finance, C programming, and how Linux operates. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and having deep conversations with my friends and family.</p>
